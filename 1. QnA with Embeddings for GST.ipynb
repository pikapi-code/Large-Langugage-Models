The information in this booklet is intended only to provide a general overview and is not intended to be treated as legal ad vice or opinion. For greater details, you are respective refer CGST/SGST/UTGST/IGST Acts. The FAQs refer to CGST and SGST Acts as CGST/SGST as CGST Act and SGST Act are identical in most of the provisions. CGST Act has been in the Parliament. The SGST Acts will be passed by respective state legislatures. A few provisions may be specific to state and may not be in CGST Act.\\n\\nintroduced\\n\\nrequested\\n\\nthe\\n\\nto\\n\\nto\\n\\n1. Overview of Goods and Services Tax (GST)\\n\\nQ 1. What is Goods and Services Tax\\n\\n(GST)?\\n\\nAns. It is a destination based tax on consumption of goods and services. It is proposed to be levied at all stages right from manufacture up to final consumption with credit of taxes paid at previous stages available as setoff. In a nutshell, only value addition will be taxed and burden of tax is to be borne by the final consumer.\\n\\nQ 2. What exactly is the concept of destination based\\n\\ntax on consumption?\\n\\nAns. The tax would accrue to the taxing authority which has jurisdiction over the place of consumption which is also termed as place of supply.\\n\\nQ 3. Which of the existing taxes are proposed to be\\n\\nsubsumed under GST?\\n\\nAns. The GST would replace the following taxes:\\n\\n(i) taxes currently levied and collected by the Centre:\\n\\na. Central Excise duty\\n\\nb. Duties of Excise Preparations)\\n\\n(Medicinal and Toilet\\n\\nc. Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special\\n\\nImportance)\\n\\nd. Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile\\n\\nProducts)\\n\\ne. Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD)\\n\\nf.\\n\\nSpecial Additional Duty of Customs (SAD)\\n\\ng. Service Tax\\n\\nh. Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they\\n\\nrelate to supply of goods and services\\n\\n(ii) State taxes that would be subsumed under the GST\\n\\nare:\\n\\na. State VAT\\n\\nb. Central Sales Tax\\n\\nc. Luxury Tax\\n\\nd. Entry Tax (all forms)\\n\\ne. Entertainment and Amusement Tax (except when\\n\\nlevied by the local bodies)\\n\\nf. Taxes on advertisements\\n\\ng. Purchase Tax\\n\\nh. Taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling\\n\\ni.\\n\\nState Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services', metadata={'source': 'data\\\\new-faq-on-gst-second-edition.pdf'})"

What principles were adopted for subsuming\\n\\nthe above taxes under GST?\\n\\nAns. The various Central, State and Local levies were examined to identify their possibility of being subsumed under GST. While identifying, the following principles were kept in mind:\\n\\n(i) Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be primarily in the nature of indirect taxes, either on the supply of goods or on the supply of services.\\n\\n(ii) Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be part of the transaction chain which commences with import/ manufacture/ production of goods or provision of services at one end and the consumption of goods and services at the other.\\n\\n(iii) The subsumation should result in free flow of tax credit in intra and inter-State levels. The taxes, levies and fees that are not specifically related to supply of goods & services should not be subsumed under GST.\\n\\n(v) Revenue fairness for both the Union and the States individually would need to be attempted.\\n\\nQ 5. Which are the commodities proposed to be kept\\n\\noutside the purview of GST?\\n\\nAns. Article 366(12A) of the Constitution as amended by 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016 defines the Goods and Services tax (GST) as a tax on supply of goods or services or both, except supply of alcoholic liquor for human consumption. So alcohol for human consumption is kept out of GST by way of definition of GST in constitution. Five petroleum products viz. petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel have temporarily been kept out and GST Council shall decide the date from which they shall be included in GST. Furthermore, electricity has been kept out of GST.\\n\\nQ 6. What will be the status in respect of taxation of above commodities after introduction of GST?\\n\\nAns. The existing taxation system (VAT & Central Excise) will continue in respect of the above commodities.\\n\\nQ 7. What will be status of Tobacco and Tobacco\\n\\nproducts under the GST regime?\\n\\nAns. Tobacco and tobacco products would be subject to GST. In addition, the Centre would have the power to levy Central Excise duty on these products.\\n\\nQ 8. What type of GST is proposed to be\\n\\nimplemented?', metadata={})"

CGST and SGST will be applicable in intra-state transactions, i.e. within the state, while IGST will be applicable in inter-state transactions, i.e. between states. UTGST will be applicable in Union Territories. GST is a destination-based tax, which means that taxes will be collected at the point of consumption, and not the point of origin.\n",
